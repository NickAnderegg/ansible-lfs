# Ansible Collection - Linux from Scratch

This project is a work-in-progress implementation of [Linux from Scratch v9.1-systemd](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable-systemd/index.html) using an Ansible collection. More documentation to come! However, I plan to document the various pieces of the project as I go, so check within each file for more detailed documentation.
